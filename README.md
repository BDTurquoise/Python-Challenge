# Python-Challenge
Module 3 Python Challenge

I have received feedback from the central grader that my files were incomplete. I have corrected the issue and am re-submitting my files for grading.

I provided the correctly labelled folders, including the .py script files, the Resources folder with the .csv data, and the .txt output files.

I also commented the items in my script, pointing out where I received tutoring help.

Thank you!
